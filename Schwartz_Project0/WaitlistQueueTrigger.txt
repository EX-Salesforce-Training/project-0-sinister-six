//Waitlist Queue Trigger
/* 
 * Trigger put on Passenger object. When a new Passenger object that has a 
 * waitlist guest record type is created, a number is assigned to that guest 
 * in queue fashion. That number is referenced when a reserved guest is deleted 
 * and the first passenger on the waitlist is added to the cruise as a reserved guest.
 * 
 * The trigger utilizes the WaitlistQueueTriggerHelper class, which contains the rest
 * of the logic of the queue implementation.
