// Challenge #9: Triggers!
// 1. Create a trigger that will check a contact that's about to be deleted! If it has any open opps, abort the deletion with an addError();
// 2. Create a trigger that checks an account about to open. If it's from Cali, don't let it get made.
// 3. Create a trigger that checks all new accounts to see if they have a related contact, and creates one if they don't!
